**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Textile Engineers!**

**Background:**

Dear Textile Engineers,

Your expertise is crucial in addressing the profound challenges faced by the global textile and fashion industry. As professionals at the forefront of material innovation and sustainability, you hold the key to transforming our sector. With a market size that reached approximately $987.95 billion in 2023 and projected to grow to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032, the urgency for sustainable practices has never been clearer. The 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion highlights the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events threaten the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, jeopardizing an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

**Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is notorious for resource depletion, pollution, and waste generation, areas where your engineering skills can lead to innovative solutions.

**Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions are pervasive issues that require your insights into ethical sourcing and production methods.

**Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and insufficient data complicates informed consumer choices. Your ability to develop and implement sustainable practices can drive transparency in our industry.

In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy aims to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It is time to harness the industry's potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon Textile Engineers, alongside fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues. 

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your expertise and voice.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the textile engineering community to this pressing issue. Recent reports from the IPC indicate we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Letâ€™s use our creativity, technical skills, and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
