**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Fashion Designers!**

**Background:**

Dear Fashion Designers,

Your creativity and vision are at the heart of the fashion industry, and your role has never been more crucial. As you navigate the complexities of design and sustainability, the global textile and fashion landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. With a market size that reached approximately $987.95 billion in 2023 and projected to grow to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032, the urgency for sustainable practices in fashion is undeniable. The 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, the Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion highlights the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are threatening the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, jeopardizing an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

**Environmental Impact:** As designers, you know firsthand how the fashion industry depletes resources, pollutes, and generates waste. Your innovative designs can lead the way to more sustainable practices.

**Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions persist in our industry. Your commitment to ethical practices can inspire change and elevate the standards for all.

**Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing can undermine your efforts. By championing transparency and accountability, you can help consumers make informed choices and support truly sustainable brands.

In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy aims to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It is time to harness our collective potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you, the creative minds of the fashion world, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will unite designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders to collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's pivotal role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your voice.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Letâ€™s use our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
