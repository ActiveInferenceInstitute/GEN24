**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Fashion Models!**

**Dear Fashion Models,**

You are at the heart of the fashion industry, and your influence is more powerful than you may realize. As the faces that bring designs to life, you have the unique ability to inspire change and advocate for a more sustainable future. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy is reaching out to you because your voice and presence are crucial in transforming our industry into a force for good.

**Background:**

The global textile and fashion industry is facing a significant challenge that impacts not only our environment but also the livelihoods of countless individuals, including many of you. With a market size that reached approximately $987.95 billion in 2023—projected to grow to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—the urgency for sustainable practices has never been more critical. The 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, the Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion highlights the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are threatening the lives of fashion workers and could jeopardize an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

**The challenges we face include:**

- **Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is notorious for depleting resources, polluting our planet, and generating overwhelming waste.
- **Human Rights Concerns:** Many models experience the effects of labor exploitation and poor working conditions firsthand, making it vital to address these pervasive issues.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and insufficient data complicates informed consumer choices and assessments of company sustainability.

In light of these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd initiative is designed to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, turning fashion into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It’s time to harness the industry’s potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society, with you leading the charge.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you, the fashion models, along with designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will focus on innovative solutions to address global waste management issues and highlight the role of models in this transformative process.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, will showcase the stories behind the garments, emphasizing how fashion can address climate change. This event elevates fashion beyond mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, will illuminate the community impact of waste, demonstrating how the fashion world can advocate for meaningful change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located only 20 kilometers away resulted in the tragic loss of over 40 lives. This is a call to action, and we need your voice and presence now more than ever.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a compelling message about waste management and the vital contributions of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry, using your platform to amplify awareness and inspire action.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and redefine our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s harness our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
