**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Systems Change Funders!**

**Background:**

Dear Systems Change Funders,

Your pivotal role in shaping sustainable practices within the fashion industry cannot be overstated. As leaders in driving systemic transformation, your expertise and resources are crucial in addressing the profound challenges our global textile and fashion industry faces. With a staggering market size of approximately $987.95 billion as of 2023—projected to grow to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—the urgency for sustainable practices has never been more pronounced. The recent 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion highlights the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events threaten the livelihoods of fashion workers and could jeopardize an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

- **Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is a major contributor to resource depletion, pollution, and waste generation.
- **Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions remain critical issues that demand our attention.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and inadequate data hampers informed consumer choices and assessments of corporate sustainability.

In light of these pressing challenges, we invite you to leverage your unique position and capabilities to be part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy aims to harness shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion into a powerful vehicle for communication, social change, and democracy. Now is the time to utilize the industry's potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you, as Systems Change Funders, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will unite fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders to collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management challenges.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the narratives behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's critical role in combating climate change. This event elevates fashion beyond aesthetics, transforming it into a powerful form of expression that celebrates resilience and resistance. Our inaugural Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, illustrated the community impact of waste, demonstrating how the fashion industry can advocate for meaningful change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away tragically resulted in the loss of over 40 lives. The time for action is now, and we need your influential voice.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that conveys a compelling message about waste management and highlights the vital contributions of the fashion and arts community to this critical issue. Recent reports from the IPC indicate that we are running out of time. Together, we can catalyze change and promote sustainable practices within the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Become a part of the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create impactful solutions and revolutionize our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s harness our collective creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
