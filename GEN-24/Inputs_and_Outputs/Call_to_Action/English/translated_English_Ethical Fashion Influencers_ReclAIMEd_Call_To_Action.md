**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Ethical Fashion Influencers!**

**Background:**

Dear Ethical Fashion Influencers,

Your voice and influence are pivotal in shaping a sustainable future for the fashion industry. As champions of ethical practices, you hold the power to drive meaningful change in a sector that faces immense challenges. The global textile and fashion industry, valued at approximately $987.95 billion in 2023 and projected to soar to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032, stands at a crucial juncture. The call for sustainable practices has never been more urgent. A recent report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion underscores the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are threatening the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, with an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports at risk by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

- **Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is notorious for resource depletion, pollution, and waste generation, which you’ve been tirelessly advocating against.
- **Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions remain pervasive issues that you are uniquely equipped to highlight and combat.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and insufficient data complicate informed consumer choices, an area where your expertise in ethical fashion can shine.

In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy aims to harness shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful vehicle for communication, social change, and democracy. It’s time to leverage the industry’s potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you—fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all stakeholders in the ethical fashion realm—to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle the global waste management crisis.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the narratives behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's critical role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion beyond aesthetics, transforming it into a powerful form of expression that celebrates journeys of resistance and resilience. Our inaugural Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, illuminated the community impact of waste, demonstrating how the fashion world can advocate for transformative change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located merely 20 kilometers away resulted in the tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your influential voice.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that communicates a powerful message about waste management and highlights the vital contributions of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. Recent reports from the IPC indicate that time is running out. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices throughout the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create impactful solutions and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s harness our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
