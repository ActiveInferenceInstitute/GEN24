**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Textile Recycling Companies!**

**Background:**

Dear Textile Recycling Companies,

Your role in the textile and fashion industry is crucial as we confront the significant environmental and social challenges that lie ahead. With the global market size reaching approximately $987.95 billion in 2023—projected to expand to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—the urgency for sustainable practices has never been more pressing. The recent 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion highlights the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events threaten the livelihoods of countless fashion workers, jeopardizing an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

**Environmental Impact:** The textile industry is notorious for resource depletion, pollution, and excessive waste generation. As recycling experts, you are uniquely positioned to mitigate these impacts through innovative solutions.

**Human Rights Concerns:** The pervasive issues of labor exploitation and poor working conditions are exacerbated by the fashion industry's wastefulness. Your commitment to recycling can help foster more ethical practices within the supply chain.

**Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and inadequate data complicates responsible consumer choices. Your expertise in recycling can help illuminate the true sustainability of fashion brands.

In light of these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a pivotal part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy seeks to harness shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a dynamic platform for communication, social change, and democracy. Together, we can create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon textile recycling companies, along with fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will foster collaboration on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, will showcase the stories behind recycled garments, emphasizing fashion's critical role in addressing climate change. This event elevates recycling from a mere afterthought to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our inaugural Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for meaningful change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your voice and expertise.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that conveys a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the textile recycling community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s leverage our creativity and passion for recycling to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
