**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Sustainable Fashion Entrepreneurs!**

**Background:**

Dear Sustainable Fashion Entrepreneurs,

Your role in shaping a more sustainable future for the fashion industry is not just vital; it is transformative. As innovators and leaders, you are at the forefront of an industry that, with a market size of approximately $987.95 billion in 2023—projected to reach nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—stands at a pivotal moment. The urgent need for sustainable practices has never been clearer. A recent report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion reveals the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are jeopardizing the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, threatening an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face together include:

**Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is a significant contributor to resource depletion, pollution, and waste generation. As Sustainable Fashion Entrepreneurs, you possess the creativity and expertise to innovate alternatives that reduce our ecological footprint.

**Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions persist in our industry. Your commitment to ethical production practices can help elevate standards and ensure fair treatment for all workers.

**Lack of Transparency:** Greenwashing and insufficient data cloud the sustainability landscape. Your efforts in promoting transparency can empower consumers to make informed choices and foster trust in the brands they support.

In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy seeks to harness shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It is time to leverage our collective potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues, a challenge you are uniquely positioned to address through your sustainable practices.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's role in combating climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your voice and vision.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s harness our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
