**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Fashion Journalists!**

**Background:**

Dear Fashion Journalists,

Your voice is vital in shaping the narrative of the fashion industry and driving it towards a more sustainable future. As you know, the global textile and fashion industry poses significant challenges to our environment and societal well-being. With a staggering market size of approximately $987.95 billion in 2023—projected to reach nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—the stakes have never been higher. The recent 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion starkly reveals the dire consequences of inaction: extreme climate events threaten the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, jeopardizing an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

**Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is notorious for depleting resources, polluting ecosystems, and generating mountains of waste.

**Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation, poor working conditions, and human rights violations remain pervasive issues that demand your attention and reporting.

**Lack of Transparency:** The prevalence of greenwashing and insufficient data complicates informed consumer choices and accurate assessments of sustainability efforts.

In light of these pressing challenges, we invite you to take a leading role in the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy is designed to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful medium for communication, social change, and democracy. It is time to harness the industry's potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society, and your expertise is crucial in this transformation.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you, the fashion journalists, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative invites designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders to collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's vital role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our inaugural Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for transformative change.

Consider this urgent reality: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your influential voice to amplify this message.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a compelling message about waste management and the essential contributions of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry, using your platform to inspire action and awareness.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s leverage our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress. Your insights, storytelling, and advocacy can make a profound difference.
