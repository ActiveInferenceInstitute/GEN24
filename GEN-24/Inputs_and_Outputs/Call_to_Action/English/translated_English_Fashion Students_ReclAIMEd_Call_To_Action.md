**Join the ReclAIME'd/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Fashion Students!**

**Background:**

Dear Fashion Students,

As the future trailblazers of the fashion industry, your creativity and vision are crucial in addressing the profound challenges we face today. The global textile and fashion industry, valued at approximately $987.95 billion in 2023 and projected to reach nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032, stands at a pivotal moment. The urgent need for sustainable practices has never been clearer. The 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion starkly outlines the consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are jeopardizing the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, threatening an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

**Environmental Impact:** The fashion industry is notorious for depleting resources, polluting our planet, and generating staggering amounts of waste. 

**Human Rights Concerns:** Labor exploitation and poor working conditions are pervasive issues that you, as future designers and influencers, can help change.

**Lack of Transparency:** The rise of greenwashing and insufficient data make it difficult for consumers to make informed choices and assess company sustainability.

In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME'd Fashion System Micro-economy aims to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It’s time to harness your unique position as students to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

**Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:**

We are calling upon you, the next generation of fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders, to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues.

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion's vital role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your voice.

**Your Role:**

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

**Take Action:**

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s use our creativity, skills, and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
