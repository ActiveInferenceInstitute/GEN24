Join the ReclAIME’d/Waste to Energy Campaign: A Call to Action for Change!

Background:

The global textile and fashion industry presents a profound challenge to our environment and human well-being. With a market size that reached approximately $987.95 billion as of 2023—projected to expand to nearly $1.35 trillion by 2032—the industry stands at a crossroads. The urgent need for sustainable practices has never been clearer. The 2024 report from McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion starkly outlines the consequences of inaction: extreme climate events are jeopardizing the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers, threatening an estimated $65 billion in apparel exports by 2030.

The challenges we face include:

Environmental Impact: The fashion industry depletes resources, pollutes, and generates waste.
Human Rights Concerns: Labor exploitation, poor working conditions, and human rights violations are pervasive issues.
Lack of Transparency: Greenwashing and insufficient data hinder informed consumer choices and assessments of company sustainability.
In response to these pressing challenges, we invite you to be a part of the solution. The ReclAIME’d Fashion System Micro-economy aims to leverage shifting consumer preferences and trends, transforming fashion from a superficial industry into a powerful tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It is time to harness the industry's potential to create economic incentives that benefit both the environment and society.

Introducing the 100 Trashion Club:

We are calling upon fashion designers, agencies, event promoters, and all relevant stakeholders to join our 100 Trashion Club. This initiative will collaborate on innovative solutions to tackle global waste management issues. 

The Shebang Trashion Show, organized by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK, showcases the stories behind the garments, emphasizing fashion’s role in addressing climate change. This event elevates fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful form of expression, celebrating journeys of resistance and resilience. Our first Trashion Show, held on July 20, 2024, highlighted the community impact of waste, illustrating how the fashion world can advocate for change.

Consider this urgent situation: just three weeks after our last Trashion Show, a landfill located a mere 20 kilometers away resulted in a tragic loss of over 40 lives. The time to act is now, and we need your voice. 

Your Role:

Join us in organizing a Trashion Runway that delivers a powerful message about waste management and the vital contribution of the fashion and arts community to this pressing issue. According to recent reports from the IPC, we are running out of time. Together, we can influence change and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

Take Action:

The ball is in your court! Join us in the 100 Trashion Club. Together, we can create solutions that matter and transform our approach to fashion and waste. Let’s use our creativity and passion to drive change and ignite conversations that lead to real, tangible progress.
