Background

The global textile and fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment and human well-being throughout its value chain, from product design to end-of-life waste management. Even with significant growth as of 2023 in market size that reached approximately $987.95 billion with projections that indicate this market to continue expanding with an expected compound annual growth rate of 3.6% between 2024 and 2032, meaning reaching a value of nearly $1.35trillion by 2032., the fashion industry is still grappling with a significant challenge as highlighted in the 2024 report by McKinsey & Company, Global Fashion Agenda, and UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion. Inaction can no longer be an option as extreme climate events are already putting the lives and livelihoods of fashion workers in danger and could put at risk an estimated $65 billion of apparel exports by 2030.

Overall, the fashion industry faces significant challenges related to sustainability and regulatory compliance to curb its significant impact on the environment and human well-being throughout its value chain, from product design to end-of-life waste management. Key points to note for the industry include;

Mass production:
·         Product Design: Up to 80% of a product's environmental impact is determined during the design phase. Regulations such as the EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation set minimum design standards focusing on recyclability, durability, and use of hazardous substances.

·         Marketing: Greenwashing, vague or misleading sustainability claims, is a concern. There is a gap to curb greenwashing by requiring specific, evidence-backed, and verified sustainability declarations.

·         Waste Management: Less than 1% of fashion textiles are recycled/upcycled, leading to significant waste generation. Synthetic fabrics, when laundered, release microplastic fibers that eventually find their way into the oceans, affecting marine ecosystems and the food chain.

·         Reporting: Despite extensive corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure, there's a lack of sufficient data and standardization. There is need to standardize ESG reporting and mandate environmental and human rights due diligence across the value chain.

·         Regulatory Landscape: Regulations, initiatives to have global implications, influencing regions like Asia, US and UK, with sustainability initiatives.

·         Challenges and Opportunities: Achieving full supply-chain visibility, decarbonizing production, and adopting circular design principles are critical. New business models, such as resale and rental, to minimize end-of-life waste.

·         Preparation for Regulation: Brands need to build regulatory competence, view regulation as an opportunity, engage with industry associations, and align strategies for effective compliance.

We could categorize three main problems;

-          Environmental Impact: The fashion industry contributes to environmental degradation through resource depletion, pollution, and waste generation.

-          Human Rights Concerns: Issues such as poor working conditions, exploitation of labor, and human rights violations are prevalent in the fashion supply chain.

-          Lack of Transparency: Greenwashing and insufficient data transparency hinder consumers' ability to make informed choices and investors' ability to assess companies' sustainability performance.

The reclAIME’d Fashion System Micro-economy map leverages the power of changing trends and consumer preferences. There is an anticipation of the global textile market growing at a growth rate of 4.0% overtime reaching $1.42 trillion by 2030 as reported by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion (BoF) in The State of Fashion 2024 report. This gives the industry the potential to challenge the facade of the fashion industry, and harness fashion's power as a tool for communication, social change, and democracy. It creates economic incentives and viable business models that benefit the environment and address critical issues. It provides the actual infrastructure to foster crosshatching of ideas for solutions, the flow of funding, information, and goodwill between all relevant stakeholders up and down the value chain harnessing the power of the textile and fashion industry’s role extends beyond aesthetics shaping our environment, health, and global climate by framing the fashion industry’s transition toward a circular economy by reducing textile waste and extending product life cycles

The reclAIME’d SYSTEM MICRO-ECONOMY bridges the gap between the runway and everyday life reflecting our collective psyche. Harnesses the ability of the craft to mirror cultural shifts, political movements, and societal norms. From gender fluidity to racial diversity to climate challenges we face today; with clear targets for emissions reduction and demonstrate commitment. The fight against climate change demands honesty, not empty promises.

The network gives humanity a shot at activating Fashion as an Ultimate Democracy Tool. Fashion transcends borders, languages, and socioeconomic barriers. It democratizes expression, allowing individuals to communicate their identities, beliefs, and aspirations. Whether through street style, DIY fashion, or cultural fusion, everyone participates in this global conversation. We are activating fashion to empower humanity to be both creators and critics.

One of the tools out of the reclAIME’d fashion system change project is the Shebang trashion show which is a relational event by the BUNTU WELLBEING EXPERIENCE NETWORK (formerly The Wellbeing Foundation, established in 2015).

SHEBANG fashion show transforms the concept of fashion from mere aesthetics to a powerful tool for communication and connection. This show celebrates the journey from oppression to expression, showcasing not just clothing, but also the stories, ideas, and cultures that shape our world. It aims to revolutionize the fashion industry, influencing both the runway and everyday life. Each garment tells a story, envisioning a future where our choices align with sustainability. This event is more than a show; it’s a ritual that uses fashion as an ultimate democracy tool. This is the tool we are using to call people, brands and stakeholders in. It is the 100 Trashion campaign, where we are inviting 100 stakeholders, {brands, designers, agencies, etc...} to organize a trashion show or be part of next year's trashion show in Uganda as ceremony in to the network working to design solutions/reclAIME'd Waste to Energy network.
